This first structure from this web app wants <br>
to make more easier get an accounting from <br>
scheduled people from any area and get a most <br>
faster pdf formt from this certifications <br>
this just a first version.<br>

### ModelBase: <br>
This contains some functions could be so very <br>
important and easier to use in every place from <br>
the project you can add soo many more functions <br>
if you want. <br>

### Cliente, Usuario: <br>
This its the model that will execute the queries <br>
in the serverside, soon i'll update it to PDO this <br>
to make more secure the site. <br>

### ErrorController: <br>
This class help me to show error layouts when i <br>
need them in every place from the project, because <br>
there's a ErrorController method en the ModelBase <br>
that is static you can use it wherever you want. <br>

### Parameters: <br>
In the confid folder there is a Parameters file <br>
that will help me/you to set a controller and <br>
action default if there is an error with the GET[] <br>
array, the app show the methods of the controller <br>
using GET[]. <br>

I'll be updating all the code commits <br>
to english soon as the methods and classes too.
